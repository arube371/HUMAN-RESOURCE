proficiency or ability, research, publications and other requirements for the higher position.

elements for the Library Promotional criteria are exactly the same as those of the teaching
academics. In addition, some Librarians teach various University courses/programmes and

not require a PhD. Promotion to the position of Librarian 1(M6) requires a Master’s degree in
LIS1, some research and professional library work experience shall suffice.

topic relevant to Makerere University library work shall be allowed to change from
administrative to academic terms.

12.1.4 Provisions of the Human Resources Development Policy
a) An employee shall be entitled to attend academic, professional, and/ or work place skills
training programmes and shall be allowed to attend/ take up development opportunities,
wherever possible.
b) Regulations shall provide the context and procedures for the different types of training in
line with the University’s Mission Statement.
50
c) The identification, monitoring and provision of human resources development initiatives
shall be based upon a framework for thorough training needs assessment using
professionally recognized methods that are sensitive to women and men staff needs.
d) The development needs of the University shall always take precedence over those of the
individual employee.
e) Each employee shall obtain permission to attend all and any type of training programme of
any duration, irrespective of the source of funding; and, thereafter, maintain contact with the
University Administration, during and after the training period.
f) Beneficiaries of human resources development initiatives shall share the acquired
knowledge with the University community within the framework as shall be stipulated in
the Regulations from time to time.
g) The opportunities and funds available for Human Resources Development programmes
shall be approved by the University Council and communicated periodically to stakeholders.
h) This Policy shall be implemented in line with the accompanying Regulations as well as
relevant provisions in the University’s policies and regulations as contained in the Human
Resources Manual and other documents.
i) The University’s Human Resources Development priorities and the Regulations shall be
reviewed, when need arises, through a consultative process with all stakeholders.
12.2 REGULATIONS
12.2.1. Priorities for Human Resources Development
(i) The Development Needs of the University and the Individual
(a) The development needs of the University are derived from and intended to address the
University’s Mission and Strategic Objectives.
(b) The development needs and priorities of the University shall take precedence over those of
an employee, irrespective of the source of sponsorship.
(ii) Supporting employees in the context of a changing Information Technology (IT) environment
Given the impact of continuing change, the pace of development of the IT infrastructure in general, and
the fact that most of the University’s work has become computer dependant, there is need to support all
employees in keeping abreast of IT developments as they affect their work.
(iii) Bolstering the work of academic and other managers (Management Development)
There are development needs to be met for top managers (academic and others), if current and future
leadership potential is to be realised. There is also a definite and continuing need for appropriate forms
of advice and support before, during and after becoming a head of Unit, Section, Department, Faculty
(College), and indeed the Vice‐Chancellor of the University. In particular, the needs of employees that
are assuming management responsibilities for the first time, when they have had little time to prepare for
an increasingly demanding management role, should be addressed.
51
(iv) Academic training and professional development of employees
The University shall support employees in Academic training and professional development with a view
to improving their performance and output.
3. The professional development of researchers
Given the place of research in the mission and strategic focus of the University, there is need to ensure
that employees involved in research, at different stages of their careers (post‐doctoral through to
principal investigator), are provided with appropriate advice to help them maximise their potential in
each of these distinctive roles, and to help them manage each of these career transitions effectively.
The professional development of Administrative and Support staff
A disparity in existing levels of provision has been noted by stakeholders in the discussions to date, in
that employees classified as manual, clerical, technical as well as administrative staff have tended to
receive less direct support for their professional and career development, compared to other categories of
employees in the University. This needs to be addressed.
Organizing and attendance of conferences and related activities
There is need to support employees in keeping abreast with developments in their discipline, profession
or work. The University has always spent a significant amount of money on supporting employees who
present papers or who fulfil some other formal role at conferences for this purpose. While this will
clearly continue to be important, it is now appropriate, in an environment where total expenditure on
human resource development activities will continue to be constrained, to examine more carefully the
pattern and value for money that the development elements of this expenditure represent.
Supporting managers in addressing performance issues
As well as helping employees to adjust to various changes, there is also need to address the range of
performance issues that can arise just after they are recruited, when they are inducted into their roles, or
at later stages of their careers in the University. Where aspects of an employee’s performance become an
issue, managers and employees need to be supported in addressing the related performance issues
appropriately. Procedures to manage individual employee performance difficulties shall be developed;
and, human resources development support for the managers involved shall be key to their successful
implementation.
Reviewing Training Priorities
The Human Resources Development priorities shall be periodically reviewed in light of changing
circumstances. Some form of interim review will be useful, say after the first three years of
implementation. If any major changes in circumstances require an immediate review of these priorities,
then the matter shall be referred back to the Human Resource Development Committee(s) and
stakeholders for consideration.
(x) The need for appraisal
Progress on a range of training and development matters will require an improved and more workable
format for performance appraisal, so that more meaningful links can be established between
departmental and individual objectives. Appraisals should be conducted annually. In order to achieve
this, paperwork and administration involved should be simplified and the process should be followed
up so that agreed actions are implemented. Momentum in this exercise will be gained and sustained
where departments take a keen interest in appraisal of employees.
(xi) Equity and Equality of opportunity
52
All the above priorities will be influenced by an understanding of good practice in the area of equal
opportunities; and, training and development providers in the University will have a key role to play in
enabling employees to interpret, appreciate and apply the principles that have been established in this
area in recent years.
